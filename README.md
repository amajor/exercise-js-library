# JS Exercise

## Using a Library

This exercise will walk you through displaying the current date and time on
a web page using plain javascript and a library called [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

See a working example at https://amajor.github.io/exercise-js-library

You'll cover the following topics:

* Finding a good library
  * Is there active work on it?  How long ago was the  latest commit?
  * Are there passing tests?
  * Is there documentation for it?
  * Is there a community around it?
* Adding a library in the browser
* Using the library
* Seeing the benefits (less code!)
